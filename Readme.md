Coding challange for a job at tavernlight 

questions 1-4 are all answered and in the repo, they were committed remotely using Visual Studio 2019 

Questions 5-7 were not done, but they have been attempted as I was able to use Git bash to download the forgotten server, it was fun familiarizing myself with git on the command line, as opposed to simply uploading files.
